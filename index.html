        <h1> playing football</h1>
        <p> i like playing football with my school friends when we have break.we sometimes get to play during freeplay. It is a simple game you just have to hit the bal into the other side's goal. I like playing as a striker, because the strikers score most of the goals but it is very tiering</p>
